This project was developed to contribute to guiding future generations towards a more sustainable lifestyle.

In addition, this project is a web game that aims to teach primary school children sustainable habits and increase their love of nature.

In this game, children can save forest animals by completing daily and weekly tasks aimed at teaching sustainable habits. In this way, children not only gain a fun experience but also try to perform simple but effective tasks with the motivation to save animals.
